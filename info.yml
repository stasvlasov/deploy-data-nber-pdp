      description: The company:patent matching utilized the attached Perl routine. Starting with files of names that had been cleaned using a series of Stata routines (a file of patent assignee names and a file of corporate names from Compustat), this uses a word frequency algorithm to identify exact matches and (scored) likely matches. The likely matches above a threshold score were then examined manually to identify matches.

  - The NBER Patent Citation Data File
abstract: 'This paper describes the database on U.S. patents that we have developed
  over the past decade, with the goal of making it widely accessible for research.
  We present main trends in U. S. patenting over the last 30 years, including a variety
  of original measures constructed with citation data, such as backward and forward
  citation lags, indices of ''originality'' and ''generality'', self-citations, etc.
  Many of these measures exhibit interesting differences across the six main technological
  categories that we have developed (comprising Computers and Communications, Drugs
  and Medical, Electrical and Electronics, Chemical, Mechanical and Others), differences
  that call for further research. To stimulate such research, the entire database
  about 3 million patents and 16 million citations is now available on the NBER website.
  We discuss key issues that arise in the use of patent citations data, and suggest
  ways of addressing them. In particular, significant changes over time in the rate
  of patenting and in the number of citations made, as well as the inevitable truncation
  of the data, make it very hard to use the raw number of citations received by different
  patents directly in a meaningful way. To remedy this problem we suggest two alternative
  approaches: the fixed-effects approach involves scaling citations by the average
  citation count for a group of patents to which the patent of interest belongs; the
  quasi-structural approach attempts to distinguish the multiple effects on citation
  rates via econometric estimation.'
